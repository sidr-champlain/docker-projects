There are two ways to accomplish a static IP Address for CentOS 7 systems.
Option 1 NMTUI:
-	Sudo nmtui
-	Then select ‘Edit Connection’ 
-	Choose the network interface and edit the connection
-	Select IPv4 and turn it form Automatic to Manual
-	Then select ‘show’ on the right and enter the correct network credentials
-	Hit close and quit and reboot the machine
Option 2 CMD:
-	First list the Network Interface name: command should be ip addr or ifconfig
-	Got to the ‘/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts’ directory
-	Run the ls command and you should see a file
-	Enter sudo vi or nano and edit the file (see below)
-	After you are finished, run nmcli networking off and then nmcli networking on
-	Run ifconfig to see newly created IP Address
